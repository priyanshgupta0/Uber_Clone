Challenges Faced 
The project was initially built with Expo, but it was a challenging task to migrate it to React Native CLI. As the tutorial video by Sonny Sangha was outdated, I encountered several bugs during the development process. However, through perseverance and diligent effort, I was able to overcome these obstacles and complete the project successfully.
